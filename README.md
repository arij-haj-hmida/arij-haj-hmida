## 🌷 About Me  
Hey, I’m **Arij** — a passionate **UI/UX designer in the making** with a love for turning ideas into beautiful, intuitive digital experiences.  
My background in **Business Computing** gives me a strong understanding of both design *and* logic — I design with empathy, but I think like a developer.  

I’m on a journey to craft interfaces that don’t just look good, but *feel right*. ✨

## 💡 My Design Philosophy  
> “Design is not just what it looks like — it’s how it *feels* when people use it.”  

I believe great design starts with understanding people — their needs, frustrations, and goals.  
My mission is to build **meaningful digital experiences** through research, creativity, and technology.
